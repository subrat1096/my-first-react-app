# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# useEffect, useCallback, useRef

useCallback
useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.

here in this project passwordGenerator function re renders when length value or number value or char value is changed.

useEffect
useEffect is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system.

here in this project when the page is first time renders it shows the side-effects.

useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not needed for rendering.
